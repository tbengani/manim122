        <h1>Precept 13 Outline</h1>
        <h3>Instructions to present:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Remove the "outline" from the URL of this page to go to the
                slides.
                <a target="_blank" href="/manim122/pc13">Or click this link</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click on the slides to 'focus' and then press "F" to go
                fullscreen
            </li>
            <li>
                Press left/right arrow keys to go to the prev/next slides (going
                back will restart animations from the beginning, not reverse
                them)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Just a couple of notes I have for those teaching with these slides:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                IMPORTANT: Please do go through the slides and wait for
                animations to end, to make sure the pacing of animations makes
                sense to you! e.g At the start of Min-Heaps it animates adding
                some nodes automatically to build the initial heap(just how I
                coded it). The actual explanation for insertion is after. *If
                you press the right arrow, there is probably something new you
                need to explain.*
            </li>
            <li>
                Remember that you can go back if you think the animation was too
                fast! (You can ask students "Should I play that again?")
            </li>
            <li>
                Spend max 1 to 1.5 mins on the priority queues section. No need
                to explain the complexities. You can add an explanation of
                pq_peek if you want.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the priority queues section, for Note 2 I recommend writing
                out what the typedef for a generic priority queue would look
                like: "typedef bool has_higher_priority_fn(elem e1, elem e2)".
                There is an asterik after this note to remind you.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the last section involving the array representation you will
                need to explain how to binary indices relate a parent and child
            </li>
        </ul>
